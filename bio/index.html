<h1 class="aheader">More about me ...</h1> 
<div class="atopic">
		<p class="apara">Born Herbert Van de Sompel 
        on March 20th 1957 in <a href="https://www.gent.be/">Ghent</a>, Belgium. 
        Europe, that is. I spent the first 5 years of my life there. Then, I followed 
        my parents to <a href="https://www.arnsberg.de/">Arnsberg</a>, Germany, 
        where we stayed until I was 11. Quite a great time that was. Back in Ghent, 
        I went to a local high school, until I was ready to go to <a href=https://www.ugent.be/en">Ghent 
        University</a>. There, I got a masters in Mathematics (1979) and 
        later a masters in computer science (1981). Well, computers nor computer 
        science were what they are today, really.</p>
      <p class="apara">I took on the position of head of library automation 
        at Ghent University (1981). My thesis for computer science had been the 
        analysis of an interlibrary loan problem and programming a solution. 
        That's why. The solution was programmed in a Pascal-like language on a 
        Digital PDP-11/34. Funny thing is that machine and application were only 
        put to sleep a couple of days before Y2K. For many years, the library 
        automation department of Ghent University was me myself and I. But over 
        the course of 17 years, I was able to build a world-class team and hence 
        a world-class <a href="https://lib.ugent.be/en">library automation environment</a>. 
        Working in the library, the information virus really caught me. I found 
        myself thinking increasingly about access to digital information, equity 
        of access, ...</p>
      <p class="apara">In 1998, I felt I needed a break. Motivated 
        by some strong supporters of my work and thinking, I applied for a  
        grant from the Belgian Science Foundation that would allow me to take 
        a leave for a year and do research to get a PhD. I received the grant 
        and what followed was quite an unforgettable year, of which I spent 6 
        months at the <a href="https://www.lanl.gov/library/">Research Library</a> of 
        the <a href="https://www.lanl.gov">Los Alamos National Laboratory</a>. 
        My stay there was supported by a travel grant from the <a href="https://www.clir.org">Council 
        On Library and Information Resources</a>. During this sabbatical, I worked 
        simultaneously on two topics. One was context-sensitive and dynamic linking 
        of scholarly information resources. This work became the topic of <a href=" http://hdl.handle.net/1854/LU-522209">my Ph.D. 
        thesis</a>, which I defended on June 9th 2000 at Ghent University. I was proud 
        to count two reknown digital library gurus -- <a href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/wya/">William 
        Y. Arms</a> and <a href="https://www.cni.org/about-cni/staff/clifford-a-lynch">Clifford 
        Lynch</a> -- on my committee. This work also led to the commercialization 
        of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SFX_(software)">SFX linking server</a> 
        that was created 
        during my research, to the process of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060814023419/http://library.caltech.edu:80/openurl/default.htm">standardizing 
        OpenURL</a> with <a href="https://www.niso.org">NISO</a>, and to the  
        adoption of open linking in the scholarly information industry. The other 
        work was related to preprints. I feel strongly about the role that preprints 
        can play in the transformation of scholarly communication. That is why 
        I <a href="http://www.openarchives.org/meetings/SantaFe1999/rhp.htm">started</a> 
        the <a href="http://www.openarchives.org">Open Archives Initiative</a> 
        with <a href="http://physics.cornell.edu/paul-ginsparg">Paul 
        Ginsparg</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rick-luce-6b595811">Rick Luce</a> in 1999. 
        The Initiative reformulated 
        its mission statement in 2000 to focus on interoperability for scholarly information.  
        Its Metadata Harvesting specification became an important tool for achieving a level of interoperability across scholarly repositories 
        and was also adopted beyond the scholarly domain.</p>
      <p class="apara">In 2000/2001, I was Visiting Assistant Professor 
        in the <a href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu">Computer Science Department</a> 
        of <a href="https://www.cornell.edu">Cornell University</a>. I was part 
        of the Digital Library Research Group, and had the exciting opportuntiy 
        to work closely with <a href="https://www.si.umich.edu/people/carl-lagoze/">Carl 
        Lagoze</a>, <a href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/wya/">William Y. Arms</a> and <a href="https://sandypayette.org/">Sandy Payette</a>. 
        Then I moved to London, UK, where I became the first Director of 
        e-Strategy and Programmes at <a href="https://www.bl.uk">The British Library</a>. 
        That didn't work out &lt;understatement&gt;too well&lt;/understatement&gt;, 
        and in March 2002 I crossed the Atlantic again, to take up a position 
        as information scientist at the <a href="https://www.lanl.gov/library/">Research 
        Library</a> of the <a href="https://www.lanl.gov">Los Alamos National Laboratory</a>.</p>
        <p class="apara">For about 17 years, I was the team leader of the <a href="http://www.lanl.gov/library/about/research-prototyping.php">
        Prototyping Team</a>, researching various aspects of scholarly communication in the digital era. 
        Over the years, we worked on a wide variety of projects, many of which have had significant impact in 
        the scholarly communication, cultural heritage, and web communities. To get an overview, it is best to have a look at <a href="https://hvdsomp.info/papers/">Papers</a>, 
        <a href="https://hvdsomp.info/presentations/">Presentations</a>, and <a href="https://hvdsomp.info/specifications/">Specifications</a>.
        </p>
        <p class="apara">
        Starting in 2010, I was Visiting Professor at  
        <a href="https://www.dans.knaw.nl/en/">DANS</a>, a scholarly data archiving organization in The Hague, Netherlands, that resorts under 
        the <a href="https://www.knaw.nl/">Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences (KNAW)</a>. 
        Colleague visitors include <a href="http://christineborgman.info/">Christine Borgman</a>, 
        <a href="http://andrew.treloar.net/">Andrew Treloar</a>, and 
        <a href="http://info.slis.indiana.edu/~katy/">Kathy Borner</a>. 
        In January 2019, I exchanged my ambulant connection with DANS for an 
        actual position as Chief Innovation Officer, and, once again, moved across the Atlantic. 
        I am enormously grateful to <a href="https://pure.knaw.nl/portal/en/persons/peter-doorn(9214e6f3-386c-4a3e-abfc-0535f2f52b5a).html">
        Peter Doorn</a>, Director of DANS, for having offered me this opportunity.  As I was back in Europe, I also 
        reconnected with my alma mater, Ghent University, and became Visiting Professor at the Internet Technology & Data Science Lab, the home of <a href="https://ruben.verborgh.org/">Ruben Verborgh</a>, 
        professor of Decentralized Web technology.
        </p>
       <p class="apara">
       Early 2021, I found myself rather surprised to be moving to Vienna, Austria, because my wife had been offered a position there, which she had dreamt 
       about for many years. It meant I had to give up my job at DANS. But I kept my affiliation and remain involved in some of 
       their activities. I also kept my connection with Ghent University.
